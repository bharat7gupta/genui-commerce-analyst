## Day 1 — Local model smoke test

- Qwen responded correctly through the provider adapter.
- Latency: 7,168 ms.
- Reported usage: 17 input and 197 output tokens.
- Request ID was unavailable.
- The output-token count is unexpectedly high for `LOCAL_MODEL_OK`.
  It may include internal reasoning tokens, but this has not been verified.
- Next: compare cold and warm calls before drawing conclusions about latency.
